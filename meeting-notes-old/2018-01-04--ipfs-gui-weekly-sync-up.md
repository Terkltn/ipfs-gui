## Notes:

- Great feedback from a real user: [read Agatha's user journey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vcgnczyQmoDJcURTLsZZm1D2JixeJXpM4T6kwMvk95k/edit) 
- The team did multiple independent experiments of trying to put the shoes of a regular user and try to get IPFS install. Right now the install docs are really focused on go-ipfs and the CLI interface which is not friendly to non technical users.
- We need to provide non-technical onboarding track.
	- The Tor project faces some of the same issues (very technical project that should be used by a broad community) and solved most of them. Let's use https://www.torproject.org as a example/inspiration on how to tacle some of UX/onboarding issues.
- OKRs  for GUI/UX
	- feel free to create PR with updates for [ipfs/in-web-browsers/OKR.md](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/blob/master/OKR.md)
- Styleguide and visual language
	- Potential inspiration: [Photon Design System](https://design.firefox.com/photon/welcome.html) from Mozilla?
- Companion knows about Station
	- We probably will use Native messaging, which requires Station to prepare env to match one from Companions manifest (more research need to be done)
- make this project Public?
	- Yes
- pick the new names
	- Yes? :-)
