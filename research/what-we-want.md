# What we want from IPFS

## Me, a casual user and web dev.

I want to run a local IPFS node so I can share files with friends super easily, without needing to use a service covered in adverts.

I want to be able to PIN datasets that I think are important, so I can contribute a little bandwidth to their continued availability on the web.

I want to be able to host websites in IPFS, and have it be as easy as surge.sh / firebase hosting. I want it the site to still be available when I close my laptop.

I want to be able to make a website I visit regularly work offline, so i can read it on the tube.

I want to control how much bandwidth it uses. I don't want it to slow down my day to day browsing.

## Me, a small business owner and member of a shared workspace.

I want to set up an IPFS node for our company. I want us to be able to host static sites and content we make for clients on IPFS. I need it to be always available, and am willing to pay some money to make that work, as we already do so with other hosting. I need it to be fast, for non-ipfs as well as ipfs users.

I'd like to set up a private IPFS node for sharing files with the company but not the whole world.

I need it to be reliable, I don't have time to maintain it.

I want to control how much bandwidth it uses. It shouldn't chew out all of the workspaces shared internet connection.
